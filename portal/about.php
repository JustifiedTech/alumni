			<h3 class="text-info text-center"> Historical Background </h3>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">As a way of addressing the critical problem of qualitative access to tertiary education, the Federal Ministry of Education decided to implement the extant government policy of equitable educational development of Nigeria, by establishing federal tertiary institutions in every State of the Federation, where they do not currently exist. To this end, a memorandum was presented by the Minister of State, Education to the Federal Executive Council, at its 39th Meeting held on Wednesday, 10th November, 2010, requesting for the establishment of 44 additional tertiary institutions nationwide, to address the twin challenges of access and equitable educational development of States in the Federation.

	


The report of the Technical Committee was presented to the Honourable Minister on Monday, 15th November, 2010, in compliance with the ministerial deadline for the submission of the report. For the effective take-off of the nine universities drawn from all the geo-political zones, the Honourable Minister of Education accompanied by the Director (Tertiary Education) Federal Ministry of Education and the Executive Secretaries of NUC and ETF, visited the identified States. With the support of the State Governments, permanent as well as take-off sites were identified. These were subsequently approved by the Federal Executive Council. Council also approved the sum of N1.5 billion for each University to be sourced from the Education Trust Fund (ETF). The Federal University Wukari, Taraba State, was one of the nine universities approved for take-off under Phase I of that initiative.

Mr. President, His Excellency Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan,GCFR, in his capacity as Visitor to the nine newly established federal universities, appointed Vice-Chancellors and Registrars for the universities on February 7, 2011. The nominees were inducted into office by the Honourable Minister of Education, in the conference room of the Federal Ministry of Education Headquarters, Abuja, on Wednesday, 9 February 2011</p>

			<p>The Wukari Campus of the Taraba State Polytechnic, housing the School of Administration and Business Studies was donated by the State Government to the Federal Government for the take-off of the Federal University Wukari, Taraba State.
